"We are practicing OOP in my PHP class. I have created mini habit tracker with a Habit class with a constructor and properties: $habitName, $category, $timeOfDay, $frequency, and $isComplete. Additionally, i have methods to: display the status based on the value of $isComplete, change the frequency and timeOfDay, and method to display the summary. Could you generate another method?"

RAW CODE
public function toggleCompletion() {
    $this->isComplete = !$this->isComplete;
    echo "Habit '" . $this->habitName . "' is now marked as " . ($this->isComplete ? "complete." : "incomplete.") . "<br>";
}

CRITIQUE
All the values in my methods are being returned while this method generated by CHATGPT echoes the output directly. This makes it harder to reuse or test the code. 
I like that CHATGPT used a ternary operator which makes the code cleaner but I ended up commenting out because I already have a method that returns the status based on the value of $isComplete. I also feel like having a toggle in this case is only useful if there's an actual toggle button that the user can interact with.
